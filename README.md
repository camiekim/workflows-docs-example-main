# Workflows examples

This repository contains examples for [Workflows documentation](https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs).

## Overview

All workflow examples are in the `src/` directory with the file format `*.{yaml/json}`.

The JSON and YAML files have equivalent behaviour and functionality. Using JSON vs YAML is a matter of personal preference.

The `.json` files are generated from the `.yaml` files.

## How to create/edit an example

1. In the `src/` directory, create or modify a **YAML** file.

2. To generate the equivalent JSON file, run the `tojson.sh` script.
